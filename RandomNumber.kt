 * Problem statement:
 * Generate a random number between 1 and 50 using the following code:
val random = Random().nextInt(50) + 1
IntelliJ helps you import the Random class from Java so that you can use it. Donâ€™t
worry about the details of imports for now.
Now, use a when statement to switch between the cases where random is in
the range 1 to 10, 11 to 20, 21 to 30, 31 to 40, or above 40. In each case, print out
a message containing the range and the exact value of random.
